	<h3><em> Self Introduction: </em></h3>
	<p class="first paragraph"> Hello everyone! My name is Florian Jane S. Evangelista, and I'm from Bagtingon, Buenavista, Marinduque. I'm 21 years old. I am the second child of five siblings. And I'm currently a second-year student at Marinduque State College.My hobby is to play softball with the youth in our barangay, and I also love to eat. Why? because food is life. When I'm not doing anything, I like to go to the river to bathe and catch river fish such as shrimp, crab, and many others. I just want it to be shared, not to brag that I am currently the SK chairperson in our barangay.</p>

	<h4><em> Background on Information Technology: </em></h4>
	<p class="second-paragraph"> I used to be computer savvy because I grew up not being interested in things related to computers.

So I promised myself that I would study computer-related things. Until I went to college, and now I am a second-year college student, I just wanted to share, which is one of the things I like as an IT student, and one of the things I learned that was taught to us is editing using the Canva app. I know how to design tarpaulins, logos,</p>
